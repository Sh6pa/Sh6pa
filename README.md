Learned a lot on how to use animations with Unreal in BP, Did the Level Design of the Boss and the Lich arena, including the Lich character abilities, enemy goblins behaviour, UI, etc.
I also did the class hierarchy so that everyone could use same system to deal damage, move, apply movements reduction, etc. and did the arena links with the door system.


**Yeti Smash** <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapapastudio.yetismash> is a game made in one month with two friends (same friends as for Sweet Nightmare) during a Game Jam
We lacked some artists (only got the penguin and yeti) but we are proud of the result and learned a lot from it (shader optimisation, bigger project organisation and time gestion)
During this project I worked on async save system, sound system, some obstacles, the main camera (dynamic FOV, etc.), events system using Unity's scrypatble object system, an additive scene loading system.
